# Sunnyside

A nice responsive landing page using Grid and Flexbox.

## Overview

Sunnyside is a landing page project suggestion from [Frontend Mentors](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), which I decided to work on alone to use CSS Grid. The project took about a week til completion.

I enjoyed building the colorful landing page in CSS Grid and making it responsive.

## Motivation

Build a landing page to show the following:

- my area of interest in the industry
- my frontend skill set
- my web design interest

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- Git
- GitHub

## Folder Structure

    |-📁app
      |-📁js
      |-📁sass
    |-📁dist
    |-📁images
    |-📃.gitignore
    |-📃README.md
    |-📃README-template.md
    |-📃index.html

## Approach

In this project, I started out desktop-first with the markup and then the styling, using flexbox for the navbar. I thought the arrow at the center would be a tricky one but not by any means. Moving down to the "Transform your brand" section, I used Grid in layout the images and content. It was pretty much with Grid all the way down til the footer where I used flexbox. The end..

## Thanks
